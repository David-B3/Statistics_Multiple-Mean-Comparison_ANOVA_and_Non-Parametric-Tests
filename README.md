# Perform a STEP by STEP multiple mean comparison on R.
This code has been developped to realize the complete process of a multiple mean comparison (ANOVA and non-parametrics tests) on R.

It is composed of : 

  1. Importation on the datafile
  2. Visualization of the data, detection of outliers
  3. Normality and homgeneity asumption 
  4. Parametric and non-parametric test for multiple means comparison
  5. Corresponding Post-Hoc tests 
  6. Visualisation of the data (graph) with significance bars and stars
  7. Exportation of the results
