# Perform a STEP by STEP multiple mean comparison analysis on R.
This code has been developed to realize the complete process of a multiple mean comparison (ANOVA and non-parametric tests) on R.

It is composed of: 

  1. Importation on the datafile
  2. Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Standard Deviation)
  3. Visualization of the data, detection of outliers
  4. Normality and homogeneity assumption 
  5. Parametric and non-parametric test for multiple means comparison
  6. Corresponding Post-Hoc tests 
  7. Visualization of the data (graph) with significance bars and stars
  8. Exportation of the results
